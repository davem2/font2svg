# font2svg

Extract all glyphs from font file(s) into svg files. Created as a way to batch extract svg files from dingbat type fonts.

## Dependencies
  * fontforge

## Possible future improvements

  * Keep empty glyphs from being exported
  * New mode of operation where svg files are extracted into subfolder(s) rather than current directory
